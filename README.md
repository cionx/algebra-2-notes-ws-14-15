Notes for _Algebra II_, WS 14/15
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cionx/algebra-2-notes-ws-14-15.svg?branch=master)][1]
=================

This repository contains my (currently incomplete) personal notes for the lecture course _Algebra II_, which was held at the University of Bonn in the winter semester of 2014/15 by Dr. David Ploog.
An up to date compiled version can be found [here][2].

- For those who want to compile these notes themselves:

  - Compiling is intented to be done using `lualatex`.
  - The bibliography is using `biber`.
  - The `gitinfo2` package is used to display the date and hash of the last commit.

  The included `make` file is intented for remote building via [travis.ci][3] and may not work on other machines.

For comments and corrections please contact me at `stelzner (at) uni-bonn.de`.
