=================

This repository contains my (currently incomplete) personal notes for the lecture course _Algebra II_, which was held at the University of Bonn in the winter semester of 2014/15 by Dr. David Ploog.
An up to date compiled version can be found [here][2].

For those who want to compile these notes themselves:

- Compiling is intented to be done using `lualatex`.
- The bibliography is using `biber`.
- The `gitinfo2` package is used to display the date and hash of the last commit.
- The following fonts are used:
  - Serif: Linux Libertine
  - Sans-serif: Linux Biolinum
  - Mathematics: [Libertinus][3]
  - Monospace: Inconsolata
- The included `make` file is intented for remote building via [travis.ci][4].
